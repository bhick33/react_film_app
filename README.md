# Design
### Home page
This is how the home page loks currently. You can 'like' movies and add them to your favourites.

Each movie tile has the title, date (year) and a favorite button in the shape of a heart.

# Extra Deveolpment
I am looking to add functionality to the app so that when a user clicks on a tile, they are taken to the MovieDB
website for that movie so they can read more about it.
